# Regression-Analysis-of-second-hand-cars
### Objective: to predict the price of a second-hand car depending on its specifications

Linear regression modeling was implemented on second-hand cars dataset to predict the price of a second-hand car depending on its specifications. Data preprocessing; data and error analysis; cleaning and validating data for uniformity and accuracy; exploratory data analysis were performed.

There are two files. One is 'Second-hand cars.csv' and the other one is 'Regression Analysis of second-hand cars.ipynb'<br>
'Second-hand cars.csv' is the Excel data file which contains the dataset<br>
In case the ipynb file cannot be opened, you can access the programme on https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/waynechanccw01/Regression-Analysis-of-second-hand-cars/blob/master/Regression%20Analysis%20of%20second-hand%20cars.ipynb
